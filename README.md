# Building-Real-Time-Weather-Monitoring-and-Visualization-System
The project fetches real-time weather data  from a public API, processes it using Apache Kafka, stores it in a PostgreSQL database, and  visualizes the data using Apache Superset. This system facilitates monitoring, analyzing, and  presenting weather metrics, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.
