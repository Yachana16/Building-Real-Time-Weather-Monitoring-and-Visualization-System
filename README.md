# Building-Real-Time-Weather-Monitoring-and-Visualization-System
The project fetches real-time weather data  from a public API, processes it using Apache Kafka, stores it in a PostgreSQL database, and  visualizes the data using Apache Superset. This system facilitates monitoring, analyzing, and  presenting weather metrics, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.
The Real-Time Weather Monitoring and Visualization System is designed to provide live updates on weather conditions using an end-to-end pipeline.
Objectives: 
1. Build a pipeline to fetch live weather data. 
2. Process and stream data using Apache Kafka. 
3. Store the transformed data in PostgreSQL. 
4. Design a real-time, auto-refreshing dashboard using Apache Superset. 
5. Enable seamless data consumption and visualization.
